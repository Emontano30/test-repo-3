                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a passionate graphic designer with over 5 years of experience in the industry. 
                    I began my career at a small design agency, where I gained valuable experience in branding, print design, and web design. 
                    I became known for my attention to detail, creativity, and ability to bring client visions to life.
                    I have since moved on to work as a freelance graphic designer, working with a range of clients across various industries, and take pride in delivering high-quality design work.
                    In my free time, I enjoy exploring new design trends and experimenting with different mediums to expand my creative abilities. 
                    I also enjoy hiking, traveling, and spending time with my dog, Max.</p>
